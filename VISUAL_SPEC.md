As part of the exercise, please create an interactive UI as close to these visual specifications as possible:

<img src="centro_full_stack_screen_1.png" alt="Screen 1"/>
<img src="centro_full_stack_screen_2.png" alt="Screen 2"/>

# Screen 1 - Time Series

For the first screen, I should be able to hover over a date point and see the inventory breakdown for any given date. This should be an interactive modal for any given date point.

# Screen 2 - Time Series

For the second screen, I should be able to have a date toggle to choose between the dates provided in the CSV. This should allow me to see the inventory breakdown by percentage for the given SKUs on the given dates.
